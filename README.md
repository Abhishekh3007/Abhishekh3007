## About Me

I am a backend-oriented software engineer with full-stack capability, comfortable working across **APIs, data models, and system boundaries**.

I value software that remains:

- **Readable under pressure**
- **Correct at scale**
- **Maintainable over time**

I prioritize clarity over cleverness and design systems that are easy to reason about, extend, and operate.

- 🎓 MCA Graduate  
- ⚙️ Backend-first mindset with end-to-end ownership  
- 🧱 Strong interest in architecture, trade-offs, and constraints  
- 🚀 Apply AI/ML only where it provides measurable value  
- ☕ Calm, methodical, and detail-oriented  

> Engineering maturity is knowing what *not* to build.
