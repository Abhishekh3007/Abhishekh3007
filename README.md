**Full-Stack Developer · Backend-Focused · System Thinker**

I build software that is clean, scalable, and boring in the best possible way.

## Who Am I?

I’m a developer who enjoys designing systems more than chasing frameworks.  
I care about **clarity**, **performance**, and **code that ages well**.

- 🎓 MCA Graduate & Software Developer  
- ⚙️ Backend-first, full-stack capable  
- 🧠 Interested in system design, APIs, and data flow  
- 🚀 Exploring AI/ML in practical, production-ready use cases  
- ☕ Debugs best with coffee and silence

> *Good software is built twice — once in the head, once in the editor.*
