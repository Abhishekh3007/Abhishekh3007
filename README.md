# Abhishek Wali

Backend-oriented software engineer who values clarity, correctness, and long-term maintainability over hype and shortcuts.

I build systems that are easy to reason about, scale predictably, and remain readable months after deployment.

## About

I am an MCA graduate with a backend-first mindset and full-stack working experience.  
My approach to software is deliberate: understand the problem deeply, design with constraints in mind, and implement with discipline.

I prefer:
- Explicit systems over clever abstractions  
- Boring, proven solutions over trendy ones  
- Code that explains itself without comments  

I care about how software behaves **under load, during failure, and over time**.

## What I Work On

- Backend services and REST APIs  
- Authentication, authorization, and role-based access  
- Data modeling and schema design  
- System boundaries and service contracts  
- Reliability, consistency, and failure handling  

I enjoy working close to the request lifecycle, database behavior, and operational trade-offs.

## How I Think About Systems

I optimize for software that:
- Is easy to maintain
- Fails safely
- Can be extended without fear

---

## Engineering Principles

- Simple > Clever  
- Correct > Fast  
- Explicit > Implicit  
- Maintainable > Impressive  

Good engineering is often invisible.

---

## Activity

I focus on **real projects and long-running systems**, not one-off demos.  
Consistency matters more than streaks.

---

## Current Focus

- Strengthening backend architecture fundamentals  
- Improving system design decision-making  
- Applying AI/ML only where it provides measurable value
