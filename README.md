## ░░ Profile
I am a backend-focused software engineer who thinks in terms of systems, boundaries, and trade-offs. My work emphasizes clarity, correctness, and long-term maintainability over short-term wins. I prefer fewer abstractions with stronger guarantees, boring solutions that work consistently, and code that explains itself without excessive commentary.

> Engineering is not about showing intelligence — it’s about removing ambiguity.

## ░░ How I Think About Software
Problem → Constraints → System Design → Data Model → API Contracts → Implementation

I focus on *why* before *how*, and trade-offs before tools.

---

## ░░ What I Build
▸ Secure authentication and RBAC systems  
▸ Backend services with clear, stable contracts  
▸ Scalable and normalized data models  
▸ Performance-aware APIs  
▸ Systems that fail safely and visibly  

I enjoy working close to request lifecycles, data flow and integrity, failure modes, and long-term system behavior.

## ░░ Current Direction
Reduce complexity → Increase reliability → Ship with confidence

Currently strengthening backend architecture fundamentals, system design thinking, and real-world application of AI/ML beyond demos.
