👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a Full-Stack Developer on a mission to craft digital experiences that are not just functional, but genuinely fun to use. My journey in code is fueled by a passion for solving problems and bringing ideas to life on the web.

🔭 I’m currently exploring the depths of the T3 Stack and serverless architecture.

🌱 I’m always learning, growing, and leveling up my skills in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

💬 Ask me about Next.js, TypeScript, and developer memes.

📫 How to reach me: You can slide into my DMs on LinkedIn.

😄 Fun fact: I believe console.log() is the most powerful debugging tool ever created.
